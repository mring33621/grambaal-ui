## Grambaal UI

### NEW PROJECT -- IN PROGRESS

- This will be the web UI app for [Grambaal](https://github.com/mring33621/the-grambaal).
- I'm using [Undertow](https://undertow.io/) for its excellent server performance.
- Right now, I'm making some Undertow-specific parts to easily render server-side templates.
- I plan to use [htmx](https://htmx.org/) for any client-side interactivity.
- Yes, there's some random login stuff in here. That will eventually move or get replaced with COTS auth.
